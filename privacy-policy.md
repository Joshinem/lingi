Privacy Policy – Lingi

Last updated: November 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how Lingi (“we”, “us”, “our”) handles information when you use the Lingi mobile application (“Lingi”, “the app”), available on iOS (iPhone and iPad).

Lingi is an educational language learning game that runs primarily on your device. We do not collect personal information such as your name, email address, or phone number through the app.

If you have any questions, you can contact us at: hello@lingiapp.com

1. Information We Collect
1.1 Data stored locally on your device

Lingi stores game-related data locally on your device using technologies such as UserDefaults and Core Data. This includes:

Game progress:

Scores (highest score, total score, lifetime score)

Matches made, misses, reaction times

Rounds played, time played, game completion stats

Progression and learning data:

Words discovered and mastered

Word mastery levels and review lists

Journey level progression

Heat / multiplier achievements

Economy and upgrades:

Gold balance (per language)

Total Gold earned and spent

Upgrades purchased and their levels

Streaks and achievements:

Daily plays count

Achievement unlock status

Ranked and performance stats:

Ranked mode high scores and attempts

Accuracy, fastest tap, average tap duration

Heat level statistics

Preferences:

Selected language(s)

Sound, music, haptics, and other settings

This data is stored on your device and is generally not transmitted to our servers (we do not operate our own analytics or account servers).

1.2 Third-party services

Certain functionality relies on third-party services that may receive limited data necessary to provide their service:

Apple Game Center (optional)

Purpose: Leaderboards and ranked mode.

Data shared: Game scores and your Game Center player identity if you choose to sign in.

Game Center is managed by Apple, and its use is governed by Apple’s privacy policy and your device/Game Center settings.

You can decline Game Center authentication and still use Lingi.

RevenueCat (in-app purchases)

Purpose: Managing in-app purchases and validating/recovering entitlements.

Data shared: Purchase transaction data (e.g. product identifiers, purchase history), an anonymous user identifier, and related metadata.

This is required for IAP functionality, including restoring purchases.

See RevenueCat’s privacy policy for details.

Apple StoreKit / App Store

Purpose: Processing in-app purchases.

Data shared: Purchase transaction details required for billing and validation.

Governed by Apple’s policies and App Store terms.

Google AdMob (future use)

At present, Lingi does not actively serve ads via AdMob in the current version.

If rewarded video ads are enabled in the future, ad providers may collect usage and interaction data as described in their privacy policies.

Any future ad integration will be clearly indicated in an updated version of this policy.

We do not use any external analytics SDKs for behavioural tracking at this time.

2. How We Use Information

We use locally stored data to:

Run core game features and mechanics.

Track your scores, streaks, Gold, upgrades, and progress.

Maintain your language learning data such as word mastery and review lists.

Power the in-app statistics and achievements screens.

Restore in-app purchases through RevenueCat and StoreKit.

We do not use this information for targeted advertising or profiling, and we do not sell user data.

3. Data Sharing and Selling

We do not:

Sell your data to third parties.

Share game statistics or local data with advertisers.

Track you across other apps or websites.

We do:

Share necessary purchase information with Apple and RevenueCat to process and restore IAPs.

Share scores with Apple Game Center if you choose to sign in.

4. Data Storage and Security

All gameplay and progression data is stored locally on your device.

Purchase-related data is stored by Apple and RevenueCat for validation and restoration.

We do not run our own backend database containing your personal profile or gameplay data.

If you delete the app from your device, local data associated with Lingi will normally be removed. Apple and RevenueCat may retain purchase records to allow restoration if you reinstall.

5. Your Rights and Controls

Because we do not run a central user account or cloud service, your main controls are on-device:

Access: You can view your scores, stats, and progression within the app’s stats/achievements screens.

Deletion: You can delete the app from your device to remove locally stored data. This does not remove Game Center data (managed by Apple) or purchase history (managed by Apple and RevenueCat).

Game Center: You can enable or disable Game Center in your iOS settings.

Purchases: You can restore purchases through the in-app restore function (if implemented) or via the App Store.

If you are in a jurisdiction with specific data protection rights (for example GDPR in the EU/UK), you can contact us at hello@lingiapp.com
 with any questions about how Lingi uses data.

6. Children’s Privacy

Lingi is rated 4+ on the App Store and is suitable for children with parental guidance.

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

We do not ask for names, email addresses, or contact details inside the app.

Parents and guardians can use Apple’s parental controls, Screen Time, and Family Sharing settings to manage access and purchases.

If you believe a child has provided personal information to us via external contact (for example, by email), please contact us so we can delete it.

7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, for example to reflect new app features or changes in third-party services. When we do, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page.

Your continued use of Lingi after changes have been published indicates your acceptance of the updated policy.
