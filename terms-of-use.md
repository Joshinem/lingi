Terms of Use – Lingi

Last updated: November 2025

These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your use of the Lingi mobile application (“Lingi”, “the app”), provided by the developer (“we”, “us”, “our”). By downloading, installing, or using Lingi, you agree to be bound by these Terms.

If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use the app.

1. App Description

Lingi is an educational language learning game focused on vocabulary training and reflex-based word matching. The app includes multiple languages (currently including Italian, Spanish, French, and German), progression systems, upgrades, achievements, and in-app purchases.

Lingi is intended for entertainment and educational purposes only.

2. Eligibility

Lingi is rated 4+ on the App Store.

If you are under the age required to consent to digital services in your country, you must have permission from a parent or legal guardian to use this app.

By using the app, you confirm that you meet any applicable age requirements or have appropriate permission.

3. License and Acceptable Use

Subject to these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to:

Download and install Lingi on an iOS device you own or control.

Use the app for personal, non-commercial purposes.

You agree that you will not:

Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the app, except where allowed by law.

Circumvent or attempt to circumvent in-app purchase mechanisms, currency systems, or progression.

Use cheats, hacks, automation tools, or exploit bugs and vulnerabilities.

Use the app for any illegal or unlawful purpose.

Copy, distribute, or modify any part of the app beyond what is explicitly permitted by these Terms or by applicable law.

We may suspend or terminate access if we believe you are violating these Terms or interfering with the proper operation of the app.

4. In-App Purchases and Virtual Currency

Lingi uses a virtual in-game currency called “Gold” which can be:

Earned through normal gameplay and achievements.

Obtained through optional in-app purchases (“IAP”).

4.1 Nature of Gold and Purchases

Gold has no real-world monetary value and cannot be exchanged for cash or any other real-world tangible or intangible value.

All purchases of Gold, lifetime upgrades (such as a permanent ×2 Gold multiplier), and Piggybank claims are processed by Apple via the App Store and/or by RevenueCat as the purchase management provider.

Prices and available products are shown in the app and may change over time.

4.2 Finality of Purchases

All in-app purchases are final and non-refundable, except where required by applicable law or Apple’s own refund policies.

If you experience issues with billing or accidental purchases, you should contact Apple Support, as they handle transactions and refunds.

4.3 Restoration of Purchases

Non-consumable purchases (for example, the lifetime ×2 Gold upgrade) can be restored on a new device using the same Apple ID, subject to Apple’s restore mechanisms and RevenueCat’s support for restoration.

Consumable purchases (such as Gold packs and Piggybank claims) are generally not restorable once used.

We are not responsible for any loss of access to purchases caused by device issues, account changes, or actions taken by Apple.

5. Game Center and Third-Party Services

Lingi optionally integrates with:

Apple Game Center for leaderboards and ranked mode.

RevenueCat for purchase management.

Apple StoreKit for billing.

Use of Game Center or the App Store is subject to Apple’s terms and policies. We are not responsible for Game Center outages, leaderboards not updating, or other third-party service issues.
